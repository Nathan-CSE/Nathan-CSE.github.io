Hi! I'm Nathan, a final-year student studying Computer Science at UNSW and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you.

As an aspiring software developer, I'm keen on exploring different aspects of the industry outside of the university environment. Throughout my time at UNSW, I've had the privilege of being involved in numerous societies and assisting in the internal goings - currently, I am the Vice President of Operations at UNSW's Alternative Investment Society, where I help run the internal operations of the society and oversee the internal IT and marketing teams.

When I'm not immersed in work or learning, you can often find me with my camera working on my photography projects, playing tennis or hanging out with friends. I find inspiration in the small moments of everyday life and strive to approach each day with gratitude and enthusiasm.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!

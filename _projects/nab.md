### Overview

In July 2023, I joined Christyna Le, Orlando Ho, and Marlene Cai to tackle the UNSW Women in Technology (WIT) x NAB case competition. The goal was clear but challenging: develop a solution enabling NAB customers to understand their carbon emissions, aligning with NAB's net-zero ambitions for 2050.

### Brainstorming Solutions

Initially, we dedicated time to thoroughly analyze the case brief. We dissected NAB’s current climate strategy, focusing on their support for customer transition plans and efforts to provide insights on reducing emissions. This deep dive helped us identify key areas where technology could make a real difference, such as improving customer awareness and engagement regarding their carbon footprint.

As we moved into the brainstorming phases we evaluated various technological solutions, including AI for personalized advice, an emissions tracking app, and carbon offsetting options within NAB’s platforms. Finally, we decided upon a new account type that would track emissions, provide actionable recommendations based on spending patterns, and reward sustainable behavior.

As we moved into the development of our proposal, we encountered an unexpected challenge. One team member voiced concerns about their ability to contribute effectively, given their uncertainties around their financial planning role and other personal commitments. This prompted a reassessment of our team roles, to keep our momentum, I took over the financial aspects, despite my lack of experience in the area, ensuring that everyone was in a position to contribute their best.

### Presentation Day

A few days after having submitted our solution for judging, we received an email notifying us that we were selected as the finalists to present our solution at NAB’s office within the Sydney CBD. Armed with a comprehensive understanding of the brief and a solid team strategy, we presented our initial idea. After this, we were then paired with a NAB mentor to receive feedback regarding our strategy, in particular they highlighted the need for a more detailed explanation of the customer impact and a clearer implementation timeline. This feedback was instrumental in refining our proposal, emphasizing the practical steps needed to bring our solution to life.

### Refining Our Approach

Taking the feedback onboard, we revised our proposal. We honed in on the specifics of how our technology could empower customers and detailed a step-by-step plan for rollout. The feedback phase had emphasized the importance of clearly demonstrating the benefit to customers and how our solution fit into NAB's broader climate goals.

The process of incorporating this feedback tested our adaptability and highlighted the value of clear communication within our team. By reallocating tasks based on the feedback and our reassessed team strengths, we were able to address the mentors' concerns and refine our solution into something more impactful.

These adjustments paid off during our final presentation. By focusing on the essentials and incorporating the feedback, we were able to present a clearer, more compelling solution - we were able to iterate on feedback effectively and adapt under pressure.

### The Result

In the end, we pleasantly surprised to take first place! Winning the competition was a significant achievement for us and the experience we gained was invaluable, teaching us the importance of clear communication, the ability to adapt quickly, and the power of a focused, collaborative effort in solving complex problems.

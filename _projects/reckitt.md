### Overview

In July 2022, I participated in the UNSW Digital Society x Reckitt case competition, where our challenge was to enhance the omnichannel shopping experience for retail hygiene products. Our team included myself, Christyna Le, Orlando Ho, and Asha Raghav. We embarked on a deep dive into Reckittâ€™s hygiene strategy, analyzing key customer needs, digital journey trends, and international market insights to identify opportunities for improvement.

### Analyzing the Current Landscape

My specific role involved a detailed analysis of Reckitt's current consumer base, focusing on understanding the omnishopper experience and the digital journey of customers in the disinfection category. This analysis was crucial for identifying gaps in the current strategy and opportunities to enhance the customer experience.

### Developing the Solution

After thorough research and brainstorming, we proposed introducing a rewards system tailored to hygiene products, inspired by Woolworths' Everyday Rewards. Our concept aimed to enrich the in-store experience while offering customers the convenience of tracking rewards through a dedicated app. This dual approach was designed to not only incentivize purchases but also to integrate seamlessly with Reckitt's digital transformation goals.

### Final Presentation and Outcome

Selected as finalists, we presented our solution at the Reckitt Office. Our presentation included an overview of the disinfectant industry, customer impact analysis, and a detailed explanation of the "Reckitt Rewards" program. We also discussed how we would measure the success of our strategy through digital channels and metrics, ensuring a solid foundation for our recommendations.

Our efforts were recognized as we placed 2nd among all competing teams. This experience also provided us with the opportunity to interact with Reckitt employees, gaining valuable insights into their operations and potential future opportunities.

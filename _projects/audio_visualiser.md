### Overview

This is my personal project that aims to allow users to visualise the audio from YouTube videos. Whilst only functional with a single user, my goal is to allow multiple users to join a session and have shared control over the video playback and visualiser options.

You can find more about the project on the [repository page!](https://github.com/Nathan-CSE/audio-visualiser)

### Overview

In December 2021, I joined the Web Software team at UNSW Illuminate, alongside Beatrice Chen, Daphne Li, Luke Simmonds, Rachel Yu, and team lead Sanojan Thiyagaraja. We were tasked with a significant project: redesigning the UNSW Illuminate website. My personal objectives were to develop my UI/UX design skills and learn the basics of frontend development.

### Upskilling and Initial Planning

Our preparation began with a series of upskilling exercises provided by our team lead during the holidays. These exercises were designed to equip us with the necessary skills for the project. For me, this was a critical period, as I had no prior experience in frontend development.

    </div>
</div>

### Drafting and Design Sketches
We started the redesign process by analyzing the existing Illuminate website and creating mood boards. This involved evaluating websites from similar societies to identify elements we liked and discussing how we could improve our current pages based on potential feedback.

The drafting phase was collaborative. We shared ideas, created design sketches, and discussed the direction of the redesign. This phase was crucial for setting the foundation of our project. We focused on ensuring our designs were not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and user-friendly.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/illuminate/minddump.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3 mt-4 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/illuminate/figma.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<br>

### Development and Iteration

Our development process was structured around weekly tasks, with team members pairing up to tackle different pages. Each week, we reviewed our work, provided feedback to each other, and iterated on our designs. This iterative approach allowed us to refine our ideas and ensure that every page met our high standards.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/illuminate/figma2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### The Final Product

By the end of Term 2, we had finalized the designs for all the required pages. The coding phase followed, with the goal of deploying the redesigned website by mid-Term 3. The result was a website that not only met our initial objectives but also showcased our team's ability to work together and produce high-quality work.

    </div>

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Upskilling in Frontend Development:** My biggest personal challenge was learning frontend development from scratch. I tackled this through pair programming and by taking on a significant role in the design aspect of the project, ensuring I contributed meaningfully while developing my skills.
- **Implementing Features:** We encountered difficulties with implementing certain features due to technical and logistical constraints. Some ideas had to be revised or dropped, but this process taught us the importance of flexibility and creative problem-solving.
- **Coordination with External Stakeholders:** Plans for integrating events and projects were affected by external factors. We learned to adapt our expectations and focus on what was achievable, ensuring the project remained on track.

This project was not only a testament to our technical abilities but also a valuable learning experience. It highlighted the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and the continuous pursuit of knowledge.

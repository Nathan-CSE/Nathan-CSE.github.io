### Overview

This was a mockup prototype designed for Sunswift's enterprise resource planning tool (ERP). Its main purpose was to visualise and manage the necessary parts of the car, including the various part hierarchies.

This prototype aims to visualise the part hierarchy below:

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/sunswift_visualisation/sunswift_bom.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

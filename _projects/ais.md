### Joining the Team and Initial Expectations

In early 2021, I was approached for the role of IT Director within UNSW's Alternative Investment Society, an opportunity that piqued my interest despite my limited experience in finance. After securing the position, I joined forces with my co-director to strategize on enhancing the society's digital presence, driven by a shared vision of creative and technological innovation.

### Laying the Groundwork

Our journey began with setting ambitious yet achievable goals for our incoming team. We aimed to not only redesign the society's website but also to implement data analytics for marketing campaigns, update the website with upcoming events, and host internal upskilling workshops. These goals were mapped out across a structured timeline, emphasizing a phased approach to execution:

- **Website Redesign:** This long-term goal was broken down into brainstorming, mockup creation using Figma, and implementation phases, with a focus on achieving a professional look that could be executed within our technical constraints.
- **Data Reports for Marketing:** Post-event analytics were planned to refine our marketing strategies, involving data collection, analysis, and presentation to the marketing team.
- **Event Updates on Website:** Regular website updates were scheduled to ensure timely information dissemination about society events.
- **Internal Upskilling Workshops:** Aimed at enhancing the team's technical skills, these workshops were intended to foster a culture of continuous learning and collaboration.

### Team Recruitment and Vision Sharing

Recruiting team members who shared our passion for technology and willingness to learn was crucial. We looked beyond technical skills, valuing drive and enthusiasm as key attributes. Once the team was formed, we shared our comprehensive vision for the year, setting clear expectations and instilling a sense of shared purpose.

### Ideation and Design Phases

The initial stages of our project involved extensive brainstorming and learning. Drawing on past experiences, particularly my time with UNSW Illuminate, I guided the team through establishing a cohesive design language and layout principles. This period also included hosting upskilling workshops to empower team members to contribute their own design ideas effectively.

We engaged in regular feedback sessions, critically evaluating our designs and iterating on them to align with our collective vision. This collaborative process allowed us to refine our concepts before moving on to the detailed design phase, where we drew inspiration from various sources to create unique page designs.

### Implementation and Deployment

The deployment phase presented significant challenges, particularly when translating our designs into the WIX platform. We encountered limitations within the website builder and had to navigate differing visions from stakeholders, including suggestions from our president and co-president on specific features like newsletter integration and educational content.

### Overcoming Challenges

Several issues arose during the project, including:

- **Vision Clashes:** Differences in vision between the subcommittee, directors, and other stakeholders required careful negotiation and compromise.
- **Motivation:** Keeping team members motivated was key. We addressed this by understanding their concerns, providing support, and fostering a positive team environment.
- **External Stakeholder Engagement:** Balancing stakeholder expectations with our project goals necessitated clear communication and flexibility.
- **Tight Deadlines:** Managing deadlines while ensuring quality required effective time management and prioritization of tasks.
- **Revisiting Our Vision:** We remained adaptable, willing to refine our vision and deliverables to align with practical considerations and stakeholder feedback.

Despite these challenges, the project was a testament to the power of collaboration, adaptability, and shared vision. The final product, while requiring adjustments along the way, was a source of pride for the entire team, showcasing our commitment to enhancing the society's digital footprint.

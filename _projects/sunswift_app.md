### Overview

This is currently a project I'm working on for Sunswift, with the aim of providing a app experience similar to those provided by leading car brands. The motivation behind this was to bring Sunswift 8 in line with modern cars and appeal to the consumer-facing aspect of the project. 

After drawing inspiration from similar car companion apps, we decided that the key aspects of the app would:
* Display car information/data (such as GPS information, odometer, vehicle state, battery information etc.)
<div />
* Use 3D models of the vehicle with animations to provide an immersive experience (as opposed to using static images)
<div />
* Provide users with remote vehicle control (i.e. remotely locking/unlocking doors, opening windows, controlling the vehicle infotainment etc.)
